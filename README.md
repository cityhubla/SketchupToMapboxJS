# Sketchup! or How I mapped the Maptime Bear's Home

Vectoria, the Maptime Bear needs a home, so let's build one, and map it out!

Here is the scope of what we are gonna do

 * Use Sketchup to build a 3d environment of the Bear's home
 * Create a high resolutiion rendering using Kerkythea
 * Create a series of highlighted areas of the Bear's home to make custom marker icons using Inkscape
 * Create a non-georeferenced geotiff using QGIS's Georeferencer Plugin
 * Create a map of the Bear's home using, Mapbox's Tilemill, to be uploaded to a Mapbox Account
 * Create a simple map with markers using Mapbox.js





### Programs used:

 * [Sketchup MAKE](https://www.sketchup.com) for 3D modeling, its free and widely accessible. For WIN/OSX
