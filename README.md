# Sketchup! or How I mapped the Maptime Bear's Home

Vectoria, the Maptime Bear needs a home, so let's build one, and map it out!

Here is the scope of what we are gonna do

 * Use Sketchup to build a 3d environment of the Bear's home
 * Create an isometric projected rendering using Kerkythea
 * Create a series of highlighted areas of the Bear's home to make custom marker icons using Inkscape
 * Create a non-georeferenced geotiff using QGIS's Georeferencer Plugin
 * Create a map of the Bear's home using, Mapbox's Tilemill, to be uploaded to a Mapbox Account
 * Create a simple map with markers using Mapbox.js





### Programs used:

 * [Sketchup MAKE](https://www.sketchup.com) for 3D modeling, its free and widely accessible
 * [Kerkythea](http://www.kerkythea.net/cms/index.php/downloads/software) for rendering 3D models, it's free software with a sketchup plugin
 * [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) for GDAL projecting a non-georeferenced image into a geotiff, it's free and open source!
 * [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for graphics editing, it's free and open source!
 * [Mapbox Tilemill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) for making map tiles, uploaded to Mapbox Server or download mbtile format, did I say free too?!
